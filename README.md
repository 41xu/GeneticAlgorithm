# GeneticAlgorithm
A very rough Genetic Algorithm, using Binary Coding as the encoding function, Roulette Wheel Selection as the selection function, One-point Crossover as the crossover funtion, and Simple Mutation as the mutation function.

A really really rough GA Algorithm demo, as my project in Artificial Intelligence class.
